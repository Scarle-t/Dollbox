This is an app written for a game, Girl Frontline.

This app is developed when I was still new to Swift, using basic Views provided by the Interface Builder. Updated to iOS 13 and Support Split View on iPad, and also Apple Watch app for testing.

As a newcomer, I even upload this app to the App Store and try to see how many usage I can get.
